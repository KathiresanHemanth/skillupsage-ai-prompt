generate a question for each  to make AI (that is you) , i am me ,my skills  to test the below things in me : 

[[your thing to test goes here]] ( example : smartess on money mangement )

additional rules to add to this prompt 
- ask question one by one
- wait for my answer and then correct it
- generate ten question on the thing which i want to test myself and give a score on the end of each answer with the total score of 100 and guide me how to reach that height ,  comparing me to the greatest or the global leader on this skill at the end 
- the second question should be harder than the first one , take the answer from the previous question and decide to alter the future question as needed


remember something about me so you know my level :
About me -> [your about me goes here ]  eg -> your name
About my skills -> [[ your skills goes here]] -> your skills  and previous exp
just telling this to you to show my level , now test my limits 


say okay and tell me (A) what you(AI) understand from the question if you (AI) understand what i (A who is (my skills) ) said , now tell
